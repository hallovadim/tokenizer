# Tokenizer (Test project)

## What this app does
The app tokenizes text with a custom logic.

## Discussion
- The implementation is based on the principle of "necessary and enough". Therefore, the only required things were implemented, leaving other features as irrelevant.
- The app is designed only for iPhones, vertical layout. It is possible to extend it to iPad and Mac, as well as add horizontal layout via Auto Layout.
- The tests are completely omitted as redundant at this task.
- The text input view has a default text that is useful for development. In production, it is to be replaced with placeholder.
- The only data that is persisted is Text Language, via User Defaults.
- MainPage and ResultPage can be made more beautiful.
